# TkInter Python Applications

This repository contains various Python applications built using **TkInter**, a standard GUI library for Python. These projects were created as part of my school assignments, and some of them are written in Italian (my native language) since they were developed for educational purposes.

## About TkInter
TkInter was released in **1991** as part of the standard Python library, making it one of the oldest GUI frameworks still in use today. While its styling options are limited compared to modern frameworks, with careful design choices, it is still possible to create visually appealing applications.

## Projects Overview

Each folder in this repository contains a unique project with its own graphical interface and functionalities. Below are some highlights:

### 1. **Car Dealership Application** (Applicazione Concessionaria)
This is the most refined project in this collection. It simulates a car dealership's system with an impressive graphical design, especially considering TkInter's limitations. The application features sleek layouts and a user-friendly interface, showcasing what can be achieved with a bit of creativity and attention to detail, despite working with a toolkit as old as TkInter.

### 2. **TkInter Calculator**
This project is a fully functional **standard and scientific calculator** built with TkInter. It supports all the basic operations you would expect from a calculator, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition, it offers advanced functionalities, including:
- **Memory operations** (store, recall, clear)
- **Trigonometric functions** (sine, cosine, tangent)
- **Exponential functions** (powers, roots, logarithms)
- **Factorial calculation**

The calculator is designed with a clean interface, making it easy to switch between standard and scientific modes. Despite TkInter's age, the layout remains intuitive and responsive.

### 3. Other Applications
- **Real Estate Agency**: A CLI application to manage real estate for real estate agencies.
- **SweetDreams confectionery**: CLI application for managing bakeries.
  
## Languages
- Some projects are entirely in Italian due to the nature of the school assignments. Feel free to explore and ask for clarifications if needed.
